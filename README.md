# **MVP Project Description: My Weekly Resolutions**

## **SUMMARY**

It is an app that aims to organise and keep track of your resolutions for the week. 

## **MOTIVATION AND DESCRIPTION**

It is based on those New Year’s Resolutions that we all make sometimes but that we forget at some point due to the difficulty of planning to do something for the whole year. With that aim, this app will help users organise what the resolutions or goals for the week will be, by planning what they will do during the week.
No more procrastinating or think that you can’t do it because you don’t know how or where to start or how to do it. Planning and setting realistic daily tasks will help people to achieve their goals.
In order to have extra motivation, apart from the satisfaction of accomplishing what you have planned, the users will set a reward that they will get if they complete all the things they planned for the week.

## **FEATURES**

### **Must-Have**

	- A form with a “submit” button in which it is specified what the weekly resolution will be, and a planning in which the user will set which days and what small tasks he/she will do during the week to accomplish that goal. The user will also specify a weekly reward that they think they deserve once that planning has been completed.
	- A section in which the planning is shown with a “done” button they will have to click on once they finish each day’s planning. Also, two buttons to check if they got the reward (“achieved”) or if they need to (“try harder”).
	
### **Nice-To-Have**

	- A Modify button in case the user circumstances change during the week and they need to modify the planning they made.
	- To see a history or record of the users’ previous or past weekly resolutions, and be able to re-use them.
	- To have a section called “Our Weekly Resolutions” that will be for resolutions shared with other people, common goals that a group of people want to accomplish together. This will need an authentication to identify the user, and on each day, it will have to be specified what each one of the people will do.
	
## **USER FLOWS**

Once the users open the app, they have two options. To add a new resolution for the week by filling in a form in which they have to select the days of the week in which they want to do something, and what they plan to do each one of those days, and also to set a reward that they will get if they achieve to complete all the tasks of each one of the days. Once they finish, they click on the submit button. 

The other option is to see their resolutions for the week, so they can check what they have to do, or click on “complete” once they finish doing when they had planned. And of course, to check at the end of the week if they got the reward after having completed all the weekly goals. They have to click on the “Achieved” button or “Try harder”.


## **DESIGN OVERVIEW**

The front end will consist of 2 pages:

	- The home page, which will have the form to add a new weekly resolution. The “Add a new resolution” navigation bar.
	- A section in which all the resolutions for the week will be displayed. The “My resolution(s) for this week” navigation bar.
